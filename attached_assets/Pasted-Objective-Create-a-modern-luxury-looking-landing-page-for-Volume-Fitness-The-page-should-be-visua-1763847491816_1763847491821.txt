Objective:
Create a modern, luxury-looking landing page for Volume Fitness. The page should be visually premium, clean, cinematic, and fitness-focused, with strong typography, smooth scrolling animations, and high-resolution background imagery.
The site will be a single-page landing page, divided into three full-screen sections that reveal as you scroll.

General Requirements

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks unless necessary).

Entire design should feel high-end, cinematic, athlete-focused, and inspired by Apple Fitness / Nike Running Club / Strava premium styling.

Use smooth scroll snapping, parallax effects, and subtle fade-in animations.

Use placeholder images for now (I will replace them later).

Make it fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

Section 1 – Hero / Intro

Background:
Full-screen high-resolution image of a group of athletes jogging in an open-wood marathon environment (use a placeholder).

Foreground Content:
Centered text with subtle fade-in:

Subtitle:
Your favorite songs, re-mixed by AI, to match every peak, sprint, and finish line.

Styling Goals:
